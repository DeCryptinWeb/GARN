# GARNE
Setting up a stack with **G**raphQL, **A**pollo, **R**eact, **N**ext and **E**xpress

## What is the purpose of this project
In the company where I work, we have a newly developed stack which is using Apollo & GraphQL. Because I wasn't involved at the time in the development, but still wanted to understand how it works behind the scenes, I tried to recreate the setup by myself. 

The goal is, to elaborate a very clean commit history which can be used as documentation for understanding the setup of such a stack and of course to have kind of a base project-setup which can be used to develop fancy apps.

## How to start the app
1. install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
3. open the CMD and cd to GARNE/client
4. run `yarn` to install all the dependencies
5. to start the project in DEV-Mode run `yarn dev`
6. to create and start a production ready build, run first `yarn build` and afterwards `yarn start`

## Progress
* Apollo & Graphql client implementation [ongoing]
* Apollo & Graphql server implementation [TBD]
